## ‚ùå What's Missing for MVP (Prioritized)

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Core Functionality (Must Have)

- [ ] Modal to select connection type (activation/inhibition)
- [ ] Connection deletion
- [ ] Store connections in Redux
- [ ] Visual feedback during connection creation

**Files to Update**:
- `EditorCanvas.jsx` - Add connection mode
- `ConnectionLine.jsx` - Make clickable/deletable

#### 2. Boolean Simulation Engine (~6 hours)
**Status**: Controls work but no actual simulation runs

**What's Needed**:
- [ ] Boolean logic evaluator for components
- [ ] Update rules based on connections (AND, OR logic)
- [ ] Step-by-step simulation loop
- [ ] Real-time state updates via Socket.IO
- [ ] Graph updates with actual simulation data

- `SimulationGraph.jsx` - Use real data instead of sample

**Example Logic**:
```javascript
// Simple Boolean evaluation
function evaluateComponent(component, inputs, connections) {
  const activeInputs = connections
    .filter(c => c.target === component.id && c.type === 'activation')
    .filter(c => inputs[c.source].state === true)
